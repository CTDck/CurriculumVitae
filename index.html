  <!-- Main bio, short personal statement on current works and my passions-->

  <p>I am a Masters Level Physics Student, currently in my final year with a passion for computer tech and software development.
    In my 4<sup>th</sup> year I wrote a literature review of <a href="Docs/2325410D_FPGA_Literature_Review_FPGA_Applications.pdf">FPGA fundamentals and their applications.</a>
    My 5<sup>th</sup> year project focused on the <a href="Docs/2325410D_Optical_Design_10m_Cryogenic_Interferometer.pdf">optical design of a cryogenic inteferometer.</a> I have had a passion for computers and all things
    tech related since I began my degree in physics and wish to branch into software development and become a full stack engineer.</p>

        <td>Problem Solver</td>
        <td>I love a good puzzle to sink my teeth into, I always look forward to breaking a problem down and analysing potential solutions and their effectiveness.</td>
        <td>During my final year project I was able to produce a complete redesign of the LHCb's alignment control method. This redesign led to a more overall robust solution
          for the 10m cryogenic interferometer in development at Glasgow University. The design in question relied on 4 optical elements instead of the proposed 3. By adding
          an additional 4<em>th</em> lens alignment and beam control were rendered more easily accessible. A comparison of the analytic solution with the practical solution
          was also constructed to highlight the effectiveness of the solution. Once proposed the supervisors were impressed at my ability to think out side of the optical cavity.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Adaptive Individual</td>
        <td>I can adapt myself to almost any working environment effectively and manage tasks and workloads effectively</td>
        <td>In progression from 3<em>rd</em> to 4<em>th</em> year we were required, if on the MPhys program, to pick a literature review topic and write a formal literature review
          on the subject. During this time there was a mix up with staff regarding my progression to the MPhys program. As a result, I started on the literature review late and was supplied
          a topic instead of picking it. I then proceeded to achieve an A4 grade for this piece entirely independant from my fellow students and academic staff.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Reliable and Responsible</td>
        <td>I strive to be reliable, once set a task to complete I ensure to finish it by the required means. I also hold my self responsible and fully own up to any mistakes and or lack of knowledge on a subject.</td>
        <td>I frequently was the source for mathematics help throughout both my degree phase and secondary education phase. I would consistently help those who were indeed stuck or seeked guidance on a subject in the field
          whilest continuing my own studies. A concrete example of this was during my 3<em>rd</em> year studying Numerical Methods, I reliably and consistently provided assistance to my fellow students in helping them understand
          either Python syntax or structuring mathmatical concepts via Python.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Leadership</td>
        <td>I have the ability to take the lead when the oppertunity presents itself and I strive in such roles. The ability to delegate tasks to achieve a goal effectively is fundamental in my opinion.</td>
        <td>Halfway throughout my secondary education I had the oppertunity to take part in a World Challenge expedition in which we went to Costa Rica to both take part in treks up and down the country but also
          contribute to the local projects that were underway in Puerto Jim√©nez. Throughout this journey, our group of 6 students would alternate leadership roles. At some points I would be guiding the expedition
          throughout the Osa Penisula at others I was analysing group performance and delegating roles and responsibilies to my fellow companions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Team Player</td>
        <td>I regard myself as an effective team player who can engage in discussions, support my fellow teammates and can ask for assistance when needed.</td>
        <td>Througout the latter half of my 3<em>rd</em> year I was part of the 3D printing microscope group. The task was split into 3 main groups, 3D model design, model function and arduino programming.
          Being part of the 3D model design subgroup I was responsible for analysing previous designs and implementing my own. I also had to rely my design choices towards my teammates in both arduino and model function
          design groups. We achieved high praise from the laboratory instructors for our ability to work effectively as a team.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Effective Communicator</td>
        <td>I believe if you cannot communicate a subject to someone then you do not have a deep understanding of the subject. I can communicate my thoughts to any audience no matter their skill level.</td>
        <td>Alongside my Gold Crest Award for the STEM in the Pipeline project, for which the final project presentation contributed heavily. I achieved top marks for presentations to academics on topics such as
          Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices and Field Programmable Gate Array function and their applications.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Computer Literate</td>
        <td>I can pick up a piece of software very quickly and have a vested interest in computer hardware/software.</td>
        <td>The majority of Physics laboratory work in my 3<em>rd</em> pre-COVID19 required reading documentation on how specific monitoring softwares work and how to read or output data from them.
          In addition to this prelab documentation reading we were also required to learn Python in our own time to utilise the new method of lab assessment, via jupyter notebooks. Finally, in my spare time I enjoy
          looking into the latest PC hardware trends or building PC rigs and assisting my friends and family with general PC issues.</td>
